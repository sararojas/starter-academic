abstract: Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a Computer Vision problem that has
  become increasingly popular over the last few years, with multiple
  applications in the medical field such as therapy using virtual and augmented
  reality, robot caregivers, virtual physical therapy and kinematic analysis.
  Nevertheless, all the machine learning algorithms developed for these
  applications are trained in small datasets with images captured in constrained
  scenarios and with information given by sensors, bounding the applicability of
  these methods. We developed a simple yet useful deep learning algorithm for
  Human Pose Estimation that uses as input only an image of a scene with people.
  The estimated position of the joints and body parts can be used to retrieve
  basic kinematic information from the people on the image that can be applied
  to the aforementioned medical applications. We focus on overcoming the limit
  of Human Pose Estimation algorithms due to jittering, aiming to preserve more
  precise pixel location. Thus, we explore different novel approaches to improve
  the precision of the existing state- of-the-art algorithms in keypoint
  estimation and evaluate them on COCO keypoint dataset, outperforming the
  current top methods. We hope our algorithm encourages the academic community
  to develop simpler but precise HPE algorithms for medical applications based
  on RGB images.
